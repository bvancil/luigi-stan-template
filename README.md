# `luigi-stan-template`

This is a horribly named repository. Why?

1. I had intended to try some Stan workflows but had difficulty getting Stan to play nice with Python 3.9.
1. It's more of an example than a template.

However, it does offer some glimpse into how I tried to adapt Luigi into something I could use to orchestrate small-scale analytical pipelines.
